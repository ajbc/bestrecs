        <p>Isn't that a great recommendation?!</p>
        <p>Are you left wondering, "...but what book should I read?"  If you don't already have a pile like I do (and rereading books is okay!), here's my advice: think of a friend who might have a good recommendation.  Then text them (or call if you're feeling ballsy) and ASK THEM.  Don't try and sneak around this by doing a social media post asking your friends broadly.  Seek someone specific out; it'll make them feel good that you thought of them.  Then, get you butt over to a library or bookstore and get a copy.  It's pretty simple.</p>
        <p>But seriously, once you get a book in your hand, turn off this device so you don't waste the next hour in some internet sinkhole.</p>
