    <h2 class="short">Also, some tips on how to make friends:</h2>
    <p>Find a group of people with similar interests.  Maybe take a class.  Colleges often offer community art and language classes.  You could also take music or dance classes or join a community band.  Gyms offer athletic classes.  Churches might have Bible study groups. Charitable organizations, hospitals, political organizations, and museums may need volunteers.  Pick something that interests you!</p>
    <p>Once you find a group of people who have something in common with you, just start talking about those interests!  Ask people about themselves and listen.</p>
