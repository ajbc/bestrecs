    <h1>Oh, you didn't know about that?<br />
        Everybody does it these days.</h1>
    <p>Here's how it works: I provide some kind of useful service for free and
    and then I collect a whole bunch of information about your behavior.  But I
    need money so I run ads on my free service.  To get more money, I want to make
    sure the right people see the right ads, so I use the information I've collected
    about you to pick just the right ads for you.  So I'm not really selling your data,
    just using it to make money.</p>
    <p>(Just to be clear, I'm not actually doing any of this because I'm not
    collecting any data or running any ads.  But companies really do this, just so-ya-know!)</a>
    <h2>Anyhoo, are you ready for your recommendation now?!</h2>
