    <h2 class="short">Okay, so for whatever reason you can't get your hands on a book.</h1>
    <p>Maybe you're stranded waiting for someone to come fix your car, or the library just closed and you don't have the budget to buy a book, or some other unfortunte combination of circumstnces.  I get it, it happens.</p>

    <h2 class="short">Here are some other ideas:</h2>
    <p>Call a friend to catch up.</p>
    <p>Do some yoga or stretch.</p>
    <p>Meditate.</p>
    <p>Make a list of things for which you are grateful.</p>
    <p>Plan for how to get a book so you're not stuck in this situation again.</p>
